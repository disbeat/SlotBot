## Introduction

Remember the thrill of a slot car race? How pressing those shitty controllers made the slot car fly over the track? We took it to the next level!


## Description

We hacked a slot car track and created a bot for controlling one of the slot cars. Can you beat the bot?

We also upgraded the controllers, so now you can use a microphone and make a roar to make the car accelerate! (other controller options will be tried)

Do not forget to train! Our online simulator allows you not only to train the track but also to code the bot! Implement a better bot than ours and we will have a bot one-on-one tryouts! Will your bot rise to this challenge?


* Technology disclaimer:

We are technology agnostics! We believe in choosing the best tool for the job, but it surely includes an Arduino for the slot cars' control and HTML5, Javascript, CSS3 for the online simulator. If you have suggestions for additional buzzwords, please let us know! :)
